<p>While surfing <a href="http://www.dzone.com/" target="_blank">dzone</a> I found a site called <a href="http://ui-patterns.com/" target="_blank">UI-Patterns</a>:</p>

<p><a href="http://ui-patterns.com/" target="_blank">UI-Patterns</a> are not the first to create a UI design library. A popular design library is the <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/" target="_blank">Yahoo! Design Pattern Library</a>. While very useful, it is far from complete. The purpose of this site is over time to fill some of the gaps – especially by providing code examples as to how how the different patterns can be implemented.</p>

<p>Some of the patterns introduced are really interesting, but the way they are presented is a few steps behind Yahoo's. It's still great work, and I can't imagine how difficult is to formalize those patterns, but having a video showing the pattern in action is an advantage over plain screenshots.</p>

<p>Another site on user interface patterns I found is <a href="http://www.welie.com/" target="_blank">Welie</a>, which covers a good list of common practices in interaction design.</p>

<p>So for those interested in getting to know more about design patterns for the user experience, here is an interesting presentation in <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/">Yahoo! User Interface Theater</a>, called "Designing the Rich Web Experience: Principles and Patterns for Rich Interaction Design on the Web". Enjoy!</p>

<p><em>Bill Scott served as a Yahoo Ajax Evangelist and engineering manager from 2005-7. In this talk, given at nearly a dozen conferences around the world, Bill taxonomizes the rich interaction patterns that characterize the evolving web — a must-see for web designers and frontend engineers</em></p>
