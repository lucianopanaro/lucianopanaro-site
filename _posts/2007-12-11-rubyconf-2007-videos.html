<p>Since I always tend to bookmark links I find interesting and many times just forget about them rightaway, I just wanted to let you know (and also remind myself) that <a href="http://rubyconf2007.confreaks.com/" target="_blank">RubyConf 2007's videos are now available</a>, so I'll be watching most (if not all) of them, and probably let you know which of them I found useful/interesting.</p>

<p>(BTW, the <a href="http://www.akitaonrails.com/2007/12/10/the-first-rails-2-0-screencast-english" target="_blank">Creating a Weblog in 15 minutes screencast was ported by Akita</a>.)</p>
