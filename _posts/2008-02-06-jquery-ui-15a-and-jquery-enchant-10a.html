<p>Finally we have<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-ui/browse_thread/thread/db8276574e20a5be/6a406868c7390d83#6a406868c7390d83" target="_blank"> alpha releases of jQuery UI 1.5 and jQuery Enchant 1.0</a> (which is the brand new effects library).</p>

<p>Of course it's far from being production ready, but it is a great preview of what the official releases will be. I can't wait to give jQuery Enchant a try!</p>
