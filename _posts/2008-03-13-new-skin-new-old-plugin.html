<p>When I launched this blog a few months ago I promised myself I would post at least weekly. Well, it is pretty obvious that I haven't. Even more, I was just able to do a few posts commenting on some news I found interesting.</p>

<p>So the inmediate question that comes up is simply "why?" . Well, there are many reasons why:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Study comes first.</li>
  <li>Work comes second (well, it comes first sometimes).</li>
  <li>I couldn't find time to write (a sort of corollary of the first two) anything I liked.</li>
  <li>I hated the template I had.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these bullets, there is one that can be (sort of) easily fixed. Creating a new appealing template that would make me want to post every week can't be <strong>that </strong>hard, right? Well, it is, especially if you are a designer-wannabe. It took me a long time to come up with a template that I liked, but I am pretty glad with the result.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I came across a plugin from John Resig with similar functionality. Since it's core implementation was far better than mine, I updated the <a href="http://lucianopanaro.com/jquery-fxqueues-plugin-20/" target="_blank">jQuery FxQueues Plugin to a 2.0 version</a>, by merging John's and my code (I also created a new example page and some unit tests).</p>

<p>So now that I have a template that I like there is one thing less preventing me from writing new posts. I have a few ideas for some posts and hopefully you will be able to read them soon.</p>

<p>Hope you like this new template as I do!</p>
