<p>If you are working with <a title="Clearance GitHub" href="http://github.com/thoughtbot/clearance" target="_blank">Clearance</a> and want to have its features (<em>script/generate clearance_features</em>), <strong>be sure to have a layout that prints flash messages</strong> (<em>notice</em>, <em>error</em>, <em>success</em> and <em>failure</em>), as these are used in some scenarios.</p>

<p>Nothing crazy, but hopefully I'm saving you a headache :).</p>
