<p>So <a href="http://jquery14.com/" target="_blank">jQuery1.4</a> has been finally released and, though I haven't been able to test the <a href="http://plugins.jquery.com/project/fxqueues" target="_blank">FX Queues plugin</a> yet with it, I already got some feedback mentioning it's not working.</p>

<p>During the next couple of days I will be releasing a new version compatible with jQuery 1.4 - It will be a good way to get back to some Javascript hacking after many months with just Ruby in my head :)</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p>

<h2>Update:</h2>

<p>So it just took me an hour to do the update to 1.4 -- seems like <strong>jQuery.queue()</strong> is behaving a little different.</p>

<p>Since the plugins site for 1.4 is still to be released, for now you can grab the code from GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/lucianopanaro/jQuery-FxQueues/tree/jQuery1.4" target="_blank">http://github.com/lucianopanaro/jQuery-FxQueues/tree/jQuery1.4</a></p>
